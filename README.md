**Description**:
IX is a Star Fox (SNES) clone made as a personal project. 

**Developer Notes**:
At the time, I was in the process of learning OpenGL and wanted to make a small game to apply my skills. Since this was my first time making a game, the code is pretty gnarly. However, the game turned out pretty well and I've learned a lot since then. I like to consider this as my debut project and look forward to improving in the future.
