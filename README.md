IX is a Star Fox clone I made as a personal project. At the time, I was in the process of learning OpenGL and wanted to make a small game to apply my skills. 

Admittedly, this was my first time making a game, thus the code is pretty gnarly. However, the game turned out pretty well and I've learned a lot since then. I like to consider this as my debut project and look forward to improving in the future.
